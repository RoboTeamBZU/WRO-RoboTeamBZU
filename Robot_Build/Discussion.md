# Discussion of Designs

Throughout the course of this project, our team went through three different design iterations before reaching the final working model. Each design contributed significantly to our learning process, as we faced and overcame different technical and structural challenges.

# Reflection
Looking back, each stage of development played a critical role in reaching the final design. The LEGO model taught us the importance of weight distribution and structural strength. The wooden model emphasized the need for precise planning and iterative improvements in both design and assembly. Finally, the third model, built with 4mm wood, showcased how problem-solving and teamwork allowed us to combine all these lessons into a fully functional car. The progression through these three models highlights the value of prototyping and iteration in engineeringÂ design.
