## Wooden Frame ( 3mm )

For the second design, our team moved on to using a 3mm wooden frame. This version was carefully planned and designed with much more attention to detail than the first. The wooden structure allowed for greater strength and durability compared to LEGO, and it also gave us more flexibility in creating a customized layout for our components. However, this model faced its own set of issues. At the time, our steering system was still not fully developed, and by the time we finalized the design, the steering mechanism we had worked on did not properly fit with the frame. Moreover, the build required a number of minor adjustments to make the frame sturdier and to ensure all components were securely attached. Although this model was not fully functional, it represented an important transition from a simple prototype to a more robust and customized design.
