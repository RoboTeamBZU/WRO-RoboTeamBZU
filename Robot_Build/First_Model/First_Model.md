## LEGO Prototype

The first prototype was built entirely from LEGO pieces. 
This model was visually appealing and provided us with a simple way to test our early concepts.
However, it quickly revealed a number of limitations.
The weight distribution was very unbalanced, and because LEGO parts were not designed to carry heavy loads, the structure could not handle the weight of the components.
This led to poor movement performance.
In addition, at this stage, our team had not yet figured out a practical steering system, which limited the functionality of the model.
Despite its shortcomings, this stage was important because it gave us insight into the structural and mechanical requirements for our robot car.
