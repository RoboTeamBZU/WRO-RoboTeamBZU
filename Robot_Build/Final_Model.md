##  Wooden Frame with Optimized Features (4mm)

The third and final design was the most successful and marked the culmination of all the lessons learned in the earlier prototypes. This model was constructed from 4mm wood, which made it much sturdier and better able to support the weight of all the components without bending or instability. Through many small adjustments and refinements, we managed to fit every component neatly into the design, ensuring both functionality and durability. The steering system, which had been problematic in earlier models, was fully implemented and operated smoothly within the final structure. Additionally, the weight distribution was carefully optimized, with heavier components placed on the side containing the motors, leading to balanced and reliable movement. Overall, this final design achieved both structural strength and mechanical efficiency, making it the most refined and practical version of the robot car.
