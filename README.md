ðŸ”¹ Introduction

This repository represents the complete WRO Future Engineers project by Team BZU.
It combines all hardware, software, and 3D-printed components to build a fully autonomous competition robot.

ðŸ”¹ Team Overview

Team Name: RoboTeam BZU

Institution: Birzeit University

Category: Future Engineers â€“ WRO

Goal: Design a robot capable of completing autonomous navigation, color recognition, and task execution on the competition field.

ðŸ”¹ Components & Modules

This repository links all submodules and components:

Raspberry Pi 4 â€“ Main controller.

Raspberry Pi Camera â€“ Vision system for object detection.

Ultrasonic Sensor â€“ Distance measurement for obstacle avoidance.

Motor with H-Bridge â€“ Drive system for movement and steering.

TCS3200 Color Sensor â€“ Color recognition for line following and object sorting.

STL Files / 3D Models â€“ Custom mounts and chassis for assembling the robot.

ðŸ”¹ Usage & Integration

Each module has its own repository with code, wiring, and examples.

The main robot program integrates sensors, motors, and camera for real-time decision-making.

Calibration files, diagrams, and instructions are included in the /docs folder.
