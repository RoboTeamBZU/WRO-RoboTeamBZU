## 🏁 Why WRO?

The **World Robot Olympiad (WRO)** inspires innovation, practical engineering, and creative problem solving. The **Future Engineers** category uniquely challenges students to create real autonomous robotic vehicles that navigate dynamic environments using sensor fusion, computer vision, and intelligent planning.

We were drawn to this category because:
- It merges **hardware and software** in a real-world setting.
- It encourages complete, open-source, engineering-based development.
- It reflects our interest in autonomous transportation and robotics.

---

## 💡 Our Approach

We designed and built a fully autonomous car from scratch using:

- **Raspberry Pi 4** as the sole processing unit (no Arduino or LEGO)
- **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **pigpio** for real-time motor and vision control
- Custom electronics and full integration with **sensors, servos, and DC motors**
- A fully rule-compliant design for WRO 2025

---

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- ✅ Real-time camera-based steering and obstacle awareness
- ✅ GPIO motor and servo control via L298N driver
- ✅ Push-button triggered starting procedure (WRO-compliant)
- 🚧 Work-in-progress: Traffic sign detection and parallel parking
- 🚧 Work-in-progress: IMU-based stability and encoder feedback
